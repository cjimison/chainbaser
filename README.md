# chainbaser

A rust implementation of the [chainbase](https://github.com/bytemaster/chainbase) library.  As per the chainbase documentation:

```
ChainBase is designed to meet the demanding requirments of blockchain applications, but is suitable for use in any application that requires a robust transactional database with the ability have near-infinate levels of undo history.

While chainbase was designed for blockchain applications, it is suitable for any program that needs to persist complex application state with the ability to undo.
```

# motivation

Why does this library exists .. for me to learn more about the blockchain tech.  I have personally found that when I can implement a system I tend to understand the theory behind it.  This library should be consider a hobby project at this point and I HIGHLY recommend that people do not use.

In the future if this sytem does become "production ready" I will update this document.  But for now, do not use it :P
